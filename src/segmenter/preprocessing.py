    TF-IDF treats ``cancelado``, ``cancelamento`` and ``cancelar`` as unrelated

    is designed for Portuguese morphology and maps all three onto ``cancel``.

    The reduction is not exhaustive. Nouns derived with suffixes such as
    ``-anca`` keep their own stem: ``cobrar`` becomes ``cobr`` while
    ``cobranca`` becomes ``cobranc``. Those families stay split, which is a
    known limitation of stemming compared to full lemmatization.
